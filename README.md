"""For this exam project I will try to create a program which can recognize wrong usage of the French contractions "au; à la; à l'; aux". As an output the program will give the inputted text along with a contraction of the contractions and of the possible adjective(s) standing between the contraction and its substantive."""

"""
1) Problems: an adjective and a substantive can take the same form /n
2) how to apply sentence analysis to recognize whether form is/n adjective of substantive?/n
3) Need of corpus based data to know gender of substantives.
